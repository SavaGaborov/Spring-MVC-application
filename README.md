# Spring-MVC-application
Eclipse, Maven, Spring, Hibernate, MySql, JSP, HTML, CSS

This project was made to demonstrate my skills from from the above-mentioned technologies.

First of all, the purpose was to understand the concept of Model-View-Controller. In addition, the idea was to integrate Hibernate with Spring and to implement that operations such as Create, Read, Update, Delete, so-called CRUD operations using Hibernate and MySql.

For the look of the project I used a template, which I modified to my needs using HTML and CSS.

The project has not finished yet, but I'm working on it continuously and I hope that I'll finish it soon.
